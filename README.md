**Atom Punk Game**

This is the first project I developed in Godot. It's a little rough around the edges, but the gameplay loop runs.

**Goal**

The goal of the game is to manage the failing systems around you while establishing a connection to the houses around the power plant. If the heat builds up too much, the power plant overloads and you fail. Connect all the houses to the power plant and each other, and you win!

**Controls**

W - Look at the forward panel

A - Look at the Left Panel

D - Look at the Right Panel

S - Toggle puzzle visibility

Left Click - Interact with puzzle elements and elements on the three panels.

**Puzzle**

The puzzle is a bit confusing at the point I stopped developing this project, so I will explain its rules here.

To solve the puzzle, all of the houses and the power plant (Lightning Bolt Symbol) must be connected into a continuous loop. There cannot be multiple loops, and there can be no dead ends. Also, each cable can only be three tiles long before entering another house or the power plant.

To place a cable, click the corresponding tile on the left side of the monitor that you want to place, then click the tile on the grid of tiles where you want to place the tile. Houses and the power plant cannot have a cable placed on them.
